# Changelog

## 0.6.0

- Registration query
  - Includes registrations with incoherent raw/pax results if they are present on disk
  - Includes registrations without category, handicap, or number
- Staging Runs query
  - Returns list of StagingRun objects, which additionally includes the arbitrary registration data included on the staging line, which might not match the proper registration data.
  - Includes items for every line, including those with fields which couldn't be parsed fully
  - This allows users to detect and be warned about problems in the crispy fish data related to staging/registration mismatches
- Remove the Results queries
  - These wrongfully trusted the metadata contained in the Registration and Staging files, which can make for wildly inaccurate results sometimes
- Convert java.io.File to java.nio.file.Path (breaking change)
- ClassDefinitionFile, RegistrationFile, StagingFile, and StagingLogFile are JVM inlined value classes
- Cleaned up the ClassDefinitionFile implementation
- Massively reduced the surface area of the API
